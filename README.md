Wallpaper Changer
=================

Wallpaper Changer is a simple application that sets the desktop wallpaper to the images contained in a user-specified folder, changing the wallpaper based on the user-selected interval.

Note that by default the operation is designed to run twice a day, but you can actually specify it to run more often should you so wish by setting the timer interval period. Also, the folder parsing for the image-containing folder is not recursive in nature.
